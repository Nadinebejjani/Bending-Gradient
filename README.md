# Bending-Gradient-
We are concerned with the propagation of 
flexural waves in anisotropic
laminated plates with relatively high slenderness ratios.
The code allows the prediction of the flexural dispersion curves using the Bending-Gradient theory (BG), which is considered as 
an extension
of the Reissner-Mindlin theory to multilayered plates. Two projections of the Bending-
Gradient model on Reissner-Mindlin models are also explored: the Shear Compliance projection (SCP) and the Shear Stiffness projection (SSP).
One can compare the obtained curves with the Finite Element Method (FEM) results 
and the First order shear deformation theory (pi^2/12-FOSDT).
